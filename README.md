@Veglo Houetchenou Gabin You have formatted this output so well and it looks great!

Just a few things,

For items that have Seat Dimensions i.e. D 21.5" W 21.5" H 20.0" in most of them, Seat Height got forgotten which is just a minor ommision.

For images, i.e., (https://www.barcalounger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Logan-7-3014-7072-86-angle-2-sca)led-500x500.jpg) if you click on it, seems to be a broken link (Not all of them), 
but if you remove the last part -scaled-500x500  -> 
(https://www.barcalounger.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Logan-7-3014-7072-86-angle-2.jpg)
the link works.

Still on images, i.e., (https://www.barcalounger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jamie-7-3673-1097-96-1.jpg removing the last part -500x500  -> 
(https://www.barcalounger.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Jamie-7-3673-1097-96-1.jpg)
the image quality increases.

Other than those few changes, everything else looks awesome!
